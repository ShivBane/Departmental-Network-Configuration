# 🏢 Departmental Network Configuration

## 📌 Introduction
This project is a **multi-floor departmental network** built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The configuration includes **advanced network security, traffic optimization, and access control mechanisms** to ensure a **robust and scalable** networking environment.

## 📖 Theoretical Concepts

### 🔹 **1. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)**
- VLANs **segment network traffic**, isolating departments for **better security and performance**.
- Each floor is assigned **multiple VLANs**, ensuring logical separation of traffic.

### 🔹 **2. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Services**
- DHCP assigns **IP addresses dynamically** to devices in different VLANs.
- Prevents **IP conflicts** and simplifies network administration.

### 🔹 **3. Inter-VLAN Routing**
- VLANs **cannot communicate directly**; thus, routers are configured with **sub-interfaces** to enable routing between VLANs.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** protocol is used for **dynamic routing**.

### 🔹 **4. Port Security**
- Restricts the **number of MAC addresses** allowed on switch ports.
- Helps prevent **unauthorized access** and **MAC flooding attacks**.

### 🔹 **5. Quality of Service (QoS)**
- **Prioritizes network traffic** based on predefined rules.
- **Voice traffic (DSCP EF)** is given **high priority** to ensure seamless communication.

### 🔹 **6. Secure Remote Management (SSH & AAA Authentication)**
- Replaces **Telnet** with **SSH (Secure Shell)** for **encrypted access**.
- **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)** is implemented for **secure login control**.

### 🔹 **7. DHCP Snooping**
- Protects the network from **rogue DHCP servers** by allowing only **trusted DHCP responses**.
- Helps prevent **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**.

## 🎯 **Why Use This Topology?**

### ✅ **Purpose of Creating Such Network Topologies**
- To enhance **network security and segmentation** in **large organizations**.
- To optimize **network traffic flow** and **reduce congestion**.
- To ensure **secure remote access and management** of networking devices.
- To simplify **IP address management** with **automated DHCP configurations**.
- To implement **network redundancy and failover mechanisms** for **reliability**.

### 🌍 **Real-World Applications**
- 🏢 **Corporate Offices:** Used to **separate different departments** like HR, IT, and Finance.
- 🎓 **Educational Institutions:** Helps in **segmenting student, faculty, and administrative networks**.
- 🏥 **Healthcare Systems:** Isolates **patient records** from general hospital traffic for **security compliance**.
- 🛍️ **Retail Chains:** Ensures **POS systems, inventory databases, and guest Wi-Fi networks** are securely separated.
- 💾 **Data Centers:** Provides **logical isolation** of different server environments for **better security and performance**.
